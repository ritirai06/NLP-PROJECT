    "### Project - Voice-enabled Chatbot\n",
    "The project is designed to create a voice-based chatbot using speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis to interact with users. It combines the \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Speech Recognition (ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts spoken input from the user into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chatbot listens to the user's voice, processes it, and understands the command or query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word2Vec (Word Embedding model):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used to represent words in vector form, allowing the bot to understand the similarity between words and their meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- By training the chatbot with word vectors, it improves the understanding of user input beyond simple keyword matching, enabling more context-aware conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing (NLP):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzes the text input to understand the intent behind the user's request (e.g., asking for the time, telling a joke, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- NLP helps the chatbot map user input to a specific intent, allowing it to choose an appropriate response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text-to-Speech (TTS):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts the text response from the chatbot back into speech, so the user can hear the response instead of reading it.\n",

    "###### A voice chatbot is a type of conversational AI that uses speech recognition (to understand spoken input) and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis (to generate spoken output) to interact with users in a voice-based format. Unlike text chatbots, which rely on typed text input and output, a voice chatbot allows users to speak to the bot and hear its responses, making the interaction more natural and hands-free."

    "##### Speech Recognition (ASR):\n",

    "- This step involves recognizing the speech input (audio) and translating it into written language.\n",

    "- Example: The user says \"What's the weather today?\" → the system converts this to text.\n",

    "#### Natural Language Processing (NLP):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The core of the chatbot that processes the text input to understand the user's intent and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chatbot determines what the user wants to do based on keywords or meanings from the speech input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This includes identifying intents (e.g., asking for the weather, requesting a joke, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The chatbot generates an appropriate text response based on the user's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text-to-Speech (TTS):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converts the text response into speech so the user can hear the chatbot's reply.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The TTS engine plays the chatbot's response through the speakers or headphones.\n",
